# 🚀 100 Days of Projects

### One project every day. Leveling up with every commit.

This repository tracks my journey through the **100 Days of Code** challenge. The rules are simple: build one project daily based on the concepts I've mastered that day, moving from fundamental HTML/CSS toward advanced JavaScript and React.
