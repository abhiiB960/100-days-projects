📅 Day 1 – Recipe Page (HTML Fundamentals)

This project marks Day 1 of my 100 Days of Projects challenge.

The goal for Day 1 was to solidify core HTML concepts by building a simple, functional project without relying on heavy styling.

🧠 Project Overview

A main index page that acts as a hub for three different recipes

Each recipe links to its own dedicated page

Every recipe page includes:

A brief description

Ingredients list

Step-by-step instructions

🎯 Purpose

This project is inspired by The Odin Project and was built to:

Practice proper HTML structure

Use semantic tags correctly

Work with links, lists, images, and basic page layout

Focus on content and structure over design

🎨 Styling

Minimal to no CSS

Emphasis on clean, readable HTML

Intentionally kept simple to strengthen fundamentals

🚀 What’s Next

From Day 2 onwards, I’ll start introducing CSS and progressively build more complex, real-world projects while continuing this daily challenge.
