📅 Day 1 – Odin Recipes (HTML Fundamentals)

This is Day 1 of my 100 Days of Projects challenge.

For the first day, I focused on strengthening core HTML fundamentals by building a simple multi-page recipe website inspired by The Odin Project.

🧠 Project Overview

A main landing page that introduces the site and links to three recipes

Each recipe opens on its own dedicated HTML page

Recipes included:

Lasagna 🍅

Persimmon Bread 🍞

Cheesy Pepper Jelly Bites 🧀

📄 Structure & Content

Each recipe page contains:

A short introduction and description

A brief history section

Ingredients listed using unordered lists

Step-by-step preparation using ordered lists

Navigation links back to the main page

The project emphasizes clear content structure, readability, and proper use of HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and semantic flow.

🎨 Styling

Very minimal CSS

Basic text styling, spacing, and alignment

No focus on layouts or advanced design

Styling kept intentionally simple to prioritize HTML fundamentals

🎯 Learning Focus

Writing clean and structured HTML

Linking multiple pages together

Using lists, images, and anchors correctly

Separating content (HTML) from styling (CSS)

Building confidence without relying on frameworks or heavy styling
